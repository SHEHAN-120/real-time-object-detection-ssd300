# Real-Time Object Detection Using SSD300 with PyTorch

This project demonstrates real-time object detection on video using the **SSD300 VGG16 model** from PyTorch's `torchvision.models.detection` module. The model is pre-trained on the COCO dataset and detects objects such as people, cars, dogs, chairs, etc.
